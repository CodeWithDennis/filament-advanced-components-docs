# Filament Advanced Components

This plugin extends existing **FilamentPHP 3** components with advanced features and enhanced functionality, offering more powerful and flexible options for your projects.

> [!NOTE]  
> All components are extending the default Filament components, so you can use them as you would use the default components without any issues. This package is designed to enhance the default components, not to replace them.

## Licences
You can buy a license for the plugin on the [AnyStack](https://checkout.anystack.sh/filament-advanced-components) website for $59.99. This is a lifetime license, which means you only need to pay once and the best part is that you can use it on multiple projects.

## Upcoming
- [ ] Multiple prefix and suffix images on components

## Components

The following components are available in the package: 

- AdvancedCheckboxList
- AdvancedSelectFilter
- AdvancedSelect
- AdvancedTextColumn
- AdvancedTextEntry
- AdvancedBadge (can only be used inside the AdvancedTextColumn)

## Usage

### Image (Prefix & Suffix)

You can add a prefix or suffix images to `AdvancedTextColumn`, `AdvancedCheckboxList`, `AdvancedSelectFilter`, `AdvancedSelect`, `AdvancedTextEntry`, `AdvancedBadge` components. This allows you to add more context to the data you are displaying.

> [!NOTE]  
> The prefix and suffix method on the `AdvancedTextColumn` is similar to `->icon('')` but with more flexibility and also allows both prefix and suffix image at the same time.

![table-with-filter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CodeWithDennis/filament-advanced-components-documentation/main/art/table-with-filter.png)


Here is an example of how you can add a prefix image to a column:

```php
AdvancedTextColumn::make('country.name')
    ->prefixImage(fn (Country $record) => asset('images/'.$record->image))
```

```php
AdvancedTextColumn::make('country.name')
    ->suffixImage(fn (Country $record) => asset('images/'.$record->image))
```

You can change the size of the image by passing a **size** option to the component.

```php
AdvancedTextColumn::make('country.name')
    ->prefixImage(fn (Country $record) => asset('images/'.$record->image))
    ->prefixImageSize(32) // Default: 16px
```

```php
AdvancedTextColumn::make('country.name')
    ->suffixImage(fn (Country $record) => asset('images/'.$record->image))
    ->suffixImageSize(32) // Default: 16px
```

Do you have a badge-able column? No worries, the image will be displayed inside the badge.

![advanced-text-column-badge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CodeWithDennis/filament-advanced-components-documentation/main/art/advanced-text-column-badge.png)

If you want to add extra attributes to the image, you can use the **prefixImageExtraAttributes** or **suffixImageExtraAttributes** methods.

```php
AdvancedTextColumn::make('country.name')
    ->prefixImage(fn (Country $record) => asset('images/'.$record->image))
    ->prefixImageExtraAttributes([
        'class' => 'pr-4',
        'style' => 'background: red'
    ])
```

```php
AdvancedTextColumn::make('country.name')
    ->suffixImage(fn (Country $record) => asset('images/'.$record->image))
    ->suffixImageExtraAttributes([
        'class' => 'pr-4',
        'style' => 'background: red'
    ])
```

### Mailable

A simple way to make a value clickable and open the default mail client with the email address.

```php
AdvancedTextColumn::make('email')
    ->mailable()
```

If you want to apply a mailable based on a condition, you can pass a closure that returns a boolean value.

```php
AdvancedTextColumn::make('email')
    ->mailable(fn (string $state) => str($state)->endsWith('.com'))
```

### Callable

A simple way to make a value clickable and open the default phone client with the phone number.

```php
AdvancedTextColumn::make('phone')
    ->callable()
```

If you want to apply a callable based on a condition, you can pass a closure that returns a boolean value.

```php
AdvancedTextColumn::make('phone')
    ->callable(fn (string $state) => str($state)->startsWith('+')),
```

### WhatsApp

A simple way to make a value clickable and open the default WhatsApp client with the phone number.

```php
AdvancedTextColumn::make('phone')
    ->whatsappable()
```

If you want to apply a WhatsApp-able based on a condition, you can pass a closure that returns a boolean value.

```php
AdvancedTextColumn::make('phone')
    ->whatsappable(fn (string $state) => str($state)->startsWith('+')),
```

### Masked
If you want to mask a value on a `AdvancedTextColumn` or `AdvancedTextEntry`, you can use the **masked** method.

![masked](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CodeWithDennis/filament-advanced-components-documentation/main/art/masked.png)
```php
AdvancedTextColumn::make('phone')
    ->masked()
```

If you want to apply a mask based on a condition, you can pass a closure that returns a boolean value.

```php
AdvancedTextColumn::make('phone')
    ->masked(! auth()->user()->is_admin)
```

You can change the mask character by passing a **maskCharacters** option to the component.

```php
AdvancedTextColumn::make('phone')
    ->masked()
    ->maskCharacters('â–ˆ')
```

Do you want to start the mask from a specific index? No worries, you can add a **maskIndex** option to the component.

```php
AdvancedTextColumn::make('phone')
    ->masked()
    ->maskIndex(5)
```

The length of the mask can be changed by adding a **maskLength** option to the component. When the length is set to `null` (default), the mask will be applied to the whole value.

```php
AdvancedTextColumn::make('phone')
    ->masked()
    ->maskLength(5)
```

## Bold
If you want to make a value bold on a `AdvancedTextColumn`, `AdvancedTextEntry`  or `AdvancedBadge`, you can use the **bold** method.

```php
AdvancedTextColumn::make('name')
    ->strikeThrough()
```

## Badges
If you want to add badges to a `AdvancedTextColumn`, you can use the **badges** method.

![advanced-text-column-badges](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CodeWithDennis/filament-advanced-components-documentation/main/art/badges.png)

```php
AdvancedTextColumn::make('name')
    ->badges([
