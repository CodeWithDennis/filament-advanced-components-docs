## Components

### Image (Prefix & Suffix)

You can add a prefix or suffix images `AdvancedTextColumn`, `AdvancedCheckboxList`, `AdvancedSelectFilter`, `AdvancedSelect`, and `AdvancedTextEntry` components. This allows you to add more context to the data you are displaying.

![advanced-text-column-badge](art/table-with-filter.png)

Here is an example of how you can add a prefix image to a column:

```php
AdvancedTextColumn::make('country.name')
    ->prefixImage(fn (Country $record) => asset('images/'.$record->image))
```

```php
AdvancedTextColumn::make('country.name')
    ->suffixImage(fn (Country $record) => asset('images/'.$record->image))
```

You can change the size of the image by passing a **size** option to the component.

```php
AdvancedTextColumn::make('country.name')
    ->prefixImage(fn (Country $record) => asset('images/'.$record->image))
    ->prefixImageSize(32) // Default: 16px
```

```php
AdvancedTextColumn::make('country.name')
    ->suffixImage(fn (Country $record) => asset('images/'.$record->image))
    ->suffixImageSize(32) // Default: 16px
```

Do you have a badge-able column? No worries, the image will be displayed inside the badge.

![advanced-text-column-badge](art/advanced-text-column-badge.png)

If you want to add extra attributes to the image, you can use the **prefixImageExtraAttributes** or **suffixImageExtraAttributes** methods.

```php
AdvancedTextColumn::make('country.name')
    ->prefixImage(fn (Country $record) => asset('images/'.$record->image))
    ->prefixImageExtraAttributes([
        'class' => 'pr-4',
        'style' => 'background: red'
    ])
```

```php
AdvancedTextColumn::make('country.name')
    ->suffixImage(fn (Country $record) => asset('images/'.$record->image))
    ->suffixImageExtraAttributes([
        'class' => 'pr-4',
        'style' => 'background: red'
    ])
```

### Mailable

A simple way to make a value clickable and open the default mail client with the email address.

```php
AdvancedTextColumn::make('email')
    ->mailable()
```

If you want to apply a mailable based on a condition, you can pass a closure that returns a boolean value.

```php
AdvancedTextColumn::make('email')
    ->mailable(fn (string $state) => str($state)->endsWith('.com'))
```

### Callable

A simple way to make a value clickable and open the default phone client with the phone number.

```php
AdvancedTextColumn::make('phone')
    ->callable()
```

If you want to apply a callable based on a condition, you can pass a closure that returns a boolean value.

```php
AdvancedTextColumn::make('phone')
    ->callable(fn (string $state) => str($state)->startsWith('+')),
```

### WhatsApp

A simple way to make a value clickable and open the default WhatsApp client with the phone number.

```php
AdvancedTextColumn::make('phone')
    ->whatsappable()
```

If you want to apply a WhatsApp-able based on a condition, you can pass a closure that returns a boolean value.

```php
AdvancedTextColumn::make('phone')
    ->whatsappable(fn (string $state) => str($state)->startsWith('+')),
```

### Masked
If you want to mask a value on a `AdvancedTextColumn` or `AdvancedTextEntry`, you can use the **masked** method.

> [!NOTE]  
> The value will only be masked on the frontend

![advanced-text-column-badge](art/masked.png)

```php
AdvancedTextColumn::make('phone')
    ->masked()
```

If you want an alternative mask, you can pass a string to the **masked** method.

```php
AdvancedTextColumn::make('phone')
    ->masked($mask = 'â–ˆ')
```
